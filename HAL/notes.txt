1. I added an image here that I think might be good at the top of the 
   front page -- see mars-bday.png

2. I also added an animated GIF -- see orbits.gif -- it is not quite
   good enough, but I can fix later.

3. Refer back to my old-mockup.png -- a simple design is good, but 
   I still like pictures.  :)  So I suggest mars-bday.png at top and 
   the animation under it to one side. (Does not have to be exactly 
   like original layout -- stick with your fields/button/etc for now.)

4. The famous.txt file has famous people in it (with fields separated
   by "|"). For sorting purposes, the first fields are: Martian month, 
   Martian day, Martian year. Next fields are Earth year, month, day;
   and finally the person's name and a short description.

5. There are too many people in this file! I will trim it later. Maybe
   you can just take the first few?

6. I will start looking at: 
     - Terms of service content
     - Privacy content
     - FAQ heading and content
     - Contact us content

7. You can be thinking: Where will we put a store? Just second page or
   maybe both? And what kind of stuff should go in it?

8. I was looking at this text here:

    span Well, remember that Martian #{@month_name} is the 21st of the 
         24 months in the MCE calendar. It has nothing to do with "our" 
         #{@month_name}! In fact, the #{@month}th is the last day of the 
         month. And the year #{@mrtn_year} sounds medieval tol us! But 
         Mars takes  nearly twice as long to orbit the sun. Think of it 
         this way: while the Earth orbited the sun #{@earth_year} times, 
         Mars only orbited #{@mrtn_year} times.

I don't know how to handle this logic -- but part of the explanation is only 
necessary 50% of the time.

The Martian months that are signs of the zodiac don't cause confusion because
everyone knows we don't have months named Gemini or Virgo or whatever. It's
only the others like Martian January (M-January) that cause confusion.
(So only the odd-numbered ones.)

Also the 21 should not be hardcoded.

Also I don't know how ordinal numbers are handled (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ...)
but I am sure Rails or some I18N library can do it.

I guess "for now" we will not do real I18N or whatever.

I deleted/added some text. What do you think of this?

Months 1, 3, 5, ...

    span Well, remember that Martian #{@month_name} is the #{ordinal(@month)} 
         of the 24 months in the MCE calendar. Martian #{@month_name} or
         M-#{@month_name} has nothing to do with "our" #{@month_name}! And
         no Martian month has more than 28 days; the last month, Taurus
         is "short," and may have 24 or 25 days. (And we should really say
         sols, not days.)

         As for the year: #{@mrtn_year} sounds medieval to us! But 
         Mars takes  nearly twice as long to orbit the sun. Think of it 
         this way: While the Earth orbited the sun #{@earth_year} times, 
         Mars only orbited #{@mrtn_year} times (so our year 1880 CE started 
         about the same time as Martian year 1000 MCE.


Months 2, 4, 6, ... (2nd sentence is omitted)

    span Well, remember that Martian #{@month_name} is the #{ordinal(@month)} 
         of the 24 months in the MCE calendar. And no Martian month has more 
         than 28 days; the last month, Taurus is "short," and may have 24 or 
         25 days.  (And we should really say sols, not days.)

         As for the year: #{@mrtn_year} sounds medieval to us! But 
         Mars takes  nearly twice as long to orbit the sun. Think of it 
         this way: While the Earth orbited the sun #{@earth_year} times, 
         Mars only orbited #{@mrtn_year} times (so our year 1880 CE started 
         about the same time as Martian year 1000 MCE.

Really only the second sentence varies with odd/even months.
