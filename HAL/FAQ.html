<b>Are you serious?</b><br>
We're serious about believing human destiny is in space, and we are 
serious about wishing you a happy birthday!

<b>Are you affiliated with NASA or SpaceX?</b><br>
We are <i>not</i> affiliated with those organizations nor are we
directly connected to any other group. We <i>do</i> wish the best
to these organizations and to many others! (By the way: As NASA 
is an entity of the US government, most of the images it creates,
with some exceptions, are in the public domain.)

<b>Is the Martian Common Era calendar an official calendar for Mars?</b><br>
It is not. There is no "official" calendar yet (though many have 
been proposed). It's likely there won't be one until humans at least
land there or perhaps not until we establish settlements.

<b>Where can I learn more about the  MCE calendar?</b><br>
